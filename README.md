DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT PURSUANT TO 735 ILCS 5/2-619

NOW COMES the Defendant, DAVID RAUCH (“Defendant”), by and through his attorneys, THE COLLINS LAW FIRM, P.C., and for his Motion to Dismiss First Amended Complaint of plaintiffs, FRANK MNUK & JESSICA RAYMOND (“Plaintiffs”), pursuant to 725 ILCS 5/2- 619 states as follows:
INTRODUCTION

On October 6, 2022, this Court granted Defendant’s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ first complaint. The first complaint asserted a single cause of action alleging that Defendant breached a standard form real estate contract which he terminated upon learning that the subject property was wetlands and unbuildable. This Court held that Defendant had properly terminated based upon the standard contingency provisions found in the template Contract at issue in this litigation. This Court also held that the Contract was unenforceable. This Court allowed Plaintiffs the chance to replead but recognized, “I’m not sure where we’re going to go after this ruling insofar as repleading, but I guess we’ll wait and see what happens.” What did happen is that Plaintiffs have re-pled, but they can’t fix the problems. While they did add allegations to try and explain the lack of closing date, they do nothing more than restate as allegations their (failed) arguments concerning the contingencies. Because the reasons for dismissal have not been cured, dismissal with prejudice is now warranted.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

The material facts are exactly the same as they were during the last briefing. According to Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint (the “Amended Complaint”)1 and Defendant’s Affidavit (the “Affidavit”),2 this is what happened. It isn’t contested.
Prior to Execution - Negotiation of Contract Contingencies

In 2020, Plaintiffs purchased land commonly known as 3S701 Mignin Drive, Warrenville (the “Land”) with the intention of building a house. Ex. 1 at ¶ 5. Shortly thereafter, Defendant reached out to Plaintiffs to inquire about purchasing the western portion of the Land (the “Property”). Ex. 1 at ¶ 6; Ex. 2 at ¶ 4. Plaintiffs advised Defendant that they were working to subdivide the Land to re-sell, and that they would be interested in selling Defendant the Property which abutted his current plot. Ex. 1 at ¶ 7; Ex. 2 at ¶ 5.
Plaintiffs and Defendant negotiated terms for Defendant’s purchase of the western parcel, which was yet to be subdivided, and engaged attorneys to draft the contract. Ex. 1 at ¶ 8. The purchase of the Property was contingent upon the final subdivision of the Land being approved. Ex. 1 at ¶ 14; Ex. 2 at ¶ 10. The Contract also contained a contingency based upon a satisfactory soil test and/or flood plain determination. Ex. 2 at ¶¶ 10, 12, 13; See “Contract,” attached as Exhibit A of Plaintiffs’ Complaint at §12. Notably the Contract did not provide for any contingency dates. See Contract generally.
Execution of the Contract

On December 23, 2020, the parties entered into the vacant land Contract for the sale of the Property for the price of $190,000. Ex. 1 at ¶¶ 10, 11, 12, 14. The Contract was modified by an attorney modification letter dated December 31, 2020 (the “Attorney Modification Letter”). Ex. 1


1 Attached hereto as Exhibit 1
2 Attached hereto as Exhibit 2

at ¶¶ 15, 16; Exhibits B & C to Ex. 1. The vacant land in question was not fully nor particularly described in the Contract as it had not been subdivided yet. Ex. 1 at ¶ 18.
On March 31, 2021, the subdivided plat was finally completed. Ex. 1 at ¶ 19. After the subdivision was recorded, there remained multiple outstanding contractual contingencies: Plaintiffs had not yet provided a title commitment to Defendant. Ex. 2 at ¶ 24; Contract at §17. Defendant was not able to apply for a Building and Sewage Permit. Ex. 2 at ¶ 25; Contract at §11. And most importantly, Defendant was entitled to obtain the results of the soil test “to obtain the necessary permits from the appropriate governmental authorities for the improvement contemplated by Buyer.” Ex. 2 at ¶¶ 10, 12, 13; Contract at §12. Plaintiffs never did provide Defendant with a title commitment. Ex. 2 at ¶ 24.
Soil Test Determines the Property is Unbuildable Wetlands

Defendant contracted with Engineering Resource Associates, Inc. (“ERA, Inc”)3 to provide a soil test on the subdivided Property. Ex. 2 at ¶ 15; Ex. D to Ex. 2. On April 15, 2021, ERA, Inc. issued its final determination that the Property contained a wetland, and further advised that the parcel was “unbuildable.” Ex. 2 at ¶¶ 16, 17, 18; Ex. D to Ex. 2. ERA, Inc. confirmed that the parcel was “not eligible for the alternative analysis wetland submittal” and that it was “part of a larger wetland larger than 0.10 acres.” Ex. 2 at ¶¶ 16, 17, 18; Ex. D to Ex. 2. Both determinations meant that the Property was “not eligible for a new home” pursuant to the DuPage County Countywide Stormwater & Floodplain Ordinance Effective May 2019. 4 Ex. 2 at ¶ 18; Ex. D to Ex. 2. In fact, the ERA report included a map of the entire area affected by the wetland, which




3 ERA, Inc. is a civil engineering and site development firm with experience in wetland delineation and mitigation, land planning and site due diligence.
4 In ruling on a motion brought pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-619, a court may take judicial notice of facts contained in public records where such notice will aid in the efficient disposition of the case. Advocate Health & Hosps. Corp. v. Bank One, N.A., 348 Ill. App. 3d 755, 759 (1st Dist. 2004).

clearly shows the boundaries of the wetland encroaching well into the Property in question. See

Ex. 8 of Ex. D of Ex. 2.

In fact, Jon Green, President of ERA wrote an email to Defendant which is attached as Exhibit B of Ex. 2. The email says:
Hi David,
See attached ordinance language regarding the alternative analysis approach to any wetland impacts to allow a house consistent with the trend of development on your parcel. The full text of the ordinance is linked here [omitted]:
The Mignin Ave side of the southerly parcel will not be eligible for a new home for the following reasons:
-the site will not be eligible for the alternatives analysis wetland submittal…
-the southerly parcel [the subject of the Contract] is not eligible for any 0.10-acre wetland impact since the affected wetland is part of a larger wetland larger than 0.10-acres.
-in our professional opinion the west half of the southerly parcel is not buildable if a home is constructed on the east side of the parcel.

Clearly, ERA told Defendant after he completed his soil test that the subject Property - the South Mignin Lot - was not buildable because it was wetlands. Plaintiffs were then desperate to try to get the city Engineer from Warrenville, Ms. Kristine Hocking, to agree that the South Mignin Lot was not wetlands and that it was buildable.5
Kristine,
When would be a good time to connect on this data next week.
All I need is written proof that the mignin lot could be built and is a buildable lot for David to close on that parcel. Ex. 3.

Of course, Ms. Hocking would not agree because it wasn’t true. She refused to say that the South Mignin Lot was buildable. Instead, she agreed that the ERA report delineated wetlands and she supported Defendant’s position that wetland determination is part of typical due diligence. See Ex. 3. Ms. Hocking told Plaintiffs:



5 The emails from Ms. Kristine Hocking (the “Warrenville Emails”), originally attached as Exhibit A to Exhibit 1 (Affidavit of Plaintiff Frank Mnuk) of Plaintiffs’ Response to Defendant’s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ original complaint are attached hereto as Exhibit 3. The Court can consider affidavits in ruling on a section 2-619 motion. Cohen v. McDonald’s Corp, 347 Ill. App. 3d 627, 632 (1st Dist. 2004).

I was informed today that ERA will delineating the wetland on your property as well as updating the draft Rauch wetland report as that was outside of the growing season. I think it makes sense to have a conversation after the delineation is performed by ERA and verified by the City. At this point, the Rauch wetland delineation is ‘draft’ and not final.
When a property is developed…the County’s Stormwater Management Ordinance comes into play for wetlands, floodplains, and net new impervious area. This information is usually investigated prior to a developer’s purchasing of the property in a ‘due diligence’ period. Ex. 3.

Ms. Hocking went on to warn Plaintiffs that because the property was wetlands, they could not even remove trees or shrubs without authorization:
Also, our wetland engineer noticed that trees and shrubs were cut down on the Burk lot and some looked to be within the wetland limits and buffer. We understand this was not known to you at the time of removal and we can work with you during the permitting process to identify what would need to be planted to mitigate these impacts. Also, no other trees/shrubs on either lot should be removed within the wetland or wetland buffer until a plan is in place. Ex. 3.

Failed Renegotiations and Termination of the Contract

Upon discovery of the determination that the Property was unbuildable due to it containing a wetland, Defendant had the absolute right to terminate the Contract. Contract at §12. Additionally, the wetland discovery along with the determination that the Property was unbuildable significantly decreased the value of the Property. Ex. 2 at ¶ 19. The wetland designation also would have been a required exception noted on the title commitment had Plaintiffs provided one. Contract at §17. Accordingly, Defendant reached out the Plaintiffs to re-negotiate or terminate the Contract. Ex. 1 at ¶ 24. On April 16, 2021, Defendant proposed three alternatives:
1) Approval & Adjust: Defendant was willing to wait for Plaintiffs to get pre-approval, in writing,

to build on the Property, and if the pre-approval came with any mitigation costs, those would be deducted from the purchase price. If Plaintiffs received pre-approval, Defendant would continue with the purchase. 2) Re-Price: Defendant was open to purchasing the Property if it was re-priced
to reflect the parcel being a wetland and unbuildable; 3) Termination: If the parties couldn’t find

a “cooperative path forward” that incorporated the new disclosure, then the Contract would be terminated. Ex. 1 at ¶ 24; Ex. 2 at ¶¶ 21, 22. As set forth above, Plaintiffs were not able to get the requested “pre-approval” from Ms. Hocking. On April 21, 2021, Plaintiffs sent an email to Defendant stating that they would not renegotiate the Contract. Ex. 1 at ¶ 25; Ex. 2 at ¶ 23. After the parties failed to re-negotiate the Contract to account for the disclosure, the Contract was terminated. Ex. 2 at ¶ 23.
Relisting and Subsequent Sale of the Property

After termination of the Contract, Plaintiffs hired a real estate broker to assist them in listing and selling the Property. Ex. 1 at ¶ 56. On June 1, 2021, Plaintiffs listed the Property. Ex. 1 at ¶ 57. Plaintiffs admit that they took reasonable steps “to sell the Property for fair market value.” Ex. 1 at ¶ 59. On May 13, 2022, Plaintiffs contracted with subsequent buyers to sell the Property for $110,000 -- $80,000 less than the prior purchase price. Ex. 1 at ¶ 60. After marketing the Property for 10 months, Plaintiffs were finally able to sell the Property for its fair market value, a sum substantially lower than its perceived value as buildable land. Ex. 1 at ¶¶ 58,59,60.
Defendant moved to dismiss their original complaint, which this Court granted on October 6, 2022. 6 Plaintiffs were granted leave to re-plead and they filed their Amended Complaint on November 17, 2022. The Amended Complaint suffers from the same deficiencies as its predecessor, and it must be dismissed with prejudice.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY & THE FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The exact issues being briefed here were already briefed and this Court has already ruled. The core issue during the last briefing was/is that Defendant was going to buy the subject Property until the ERA report came back that the Property was classified as “wetlands” and “unbuildable.”



6 This Court’s Order and transcript of the hearing is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.

Plaintiffs argued during the last briefing that the contract contingencies did not apply, and the contingencies were not a proper basis for Defendant terminating the Contract. This Court ruled:
“Here are my findings based on all this...the parties are stuck with the contract they signed with all contingencies.
Contingencies were not met by the parties, regardless of whether the building of a building or a home was intended by the defendant. Blanks in the Contract were not filled in. The wetland discovery mid-contract or mid-contract negotiation did cause buyer to properly cancel the contract, which I think they did properly in writing. I’m granting the motion to dismiss.” Ex. 4, pp. 24-25.

Now Plaintiffs have filed their Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs have made a few changes. For example, they try to address an issue raised by the Court concerning the closing date. Plaintiffs now attach the Attorney Modification Letter which indicated that the closing would be “within 21 days of the final approval to subdivide the Land.” Ex. 1 ¶ 17.
However, with regard to the contingencies, Plaintiffs do not change their position at all. Instead, the Amended Complaint merely states as allegations that each contract contingency was not a proper basis for Defendant to terminate the Contract (see, e.g., Ex. 1):
¶ 28 “The Agreement contains three provisions Rauch claims eliminated his obligations under the Agreement.”
¶ 36 “Paragraph 12 does not relieve Rauch of his obligations under the Agreement.”
¶ 55 “Paragraph 17 does not relieve Rauch from his obligations under the Agreement.”

In other words - and this is critical to the current motion – with regard to the contingencies, Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint just states as allegations the very same arguments Plaintiffs made in briefing the previous motion to dismiss. They say the same thing in the Amended Complaint that they said in response to the last motion to dismiss the first complaint: (i) that they don’t think the contingency in paragraph 12 applies to the Wetland Delineation Report (¶ 41), (ii) that they would have given a title commitment to Rauch at some point before the closing (¶ 50), and (iii) that Rauch never applied for any permits (¶ 31). It is exactly what they said in their response to

the motion to dismiss last time, which means these “new” allegations not really new at all. They are the very arguments this Court has already rejected.
STANDARD OF LAW

A motion for involuntary dismissal under Section 2-619 admits the legal sufficiency of plaintiffs’ complaint but asserts an affirmative matter, including a defense, that defeats the claim. Wallace v. Smyth, 203 Ill. 2d 441, 447 (2002); Patrick Engineering, Inc. v. City of Naperville, 2012 IL 113148, ¶31; 735 ILCS 5/2-619(a)(9).
ARGUMENT

Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint Must be Dismissed with Prejudice, as the Contract Contained Numerous Contingencies Which Were Not Met and Caused Defendant to Properly Cancel the Contract.

At no time did the parties contemplate an “as-is” contract. The final Contract contained several contingencies which were not waived, and the Contract was legally terminated by Defendant when certain contingencies were not met. As such, Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint must be dismissed with prejudice.
Where a contract contains a condition precedent, such as a contingency in a real estate contract, the contract is neither enforceable nor effective until the condition is performed or the contingency occurs; if the condition remains unsatisfied, the obligations of the parties are at an end. Carollo v. Irwin, 2011 IL App (1st) 102765 at ¶ 25 (1st Dist. 2011).
In dismissing Plaintiffs’ original complaint, the Court found that the contingencies in the Contract were not met by the parties. See Ex. 4 at 25: 6-12. This remains true despite Plaintiffs’ re-filing. Specifically, Defendant was never afforded a title commitment; Defendant was not able to apply for a building permit; and most importantly, Defendant was afforded the right to have a soil test –which he did, the results of which caused him to properly terminate the Contract. Id.

To the extent that Plaintiffs argue Defendant waived contingencies due to missing deadlines, it is important to note that the closing date, and indeed, all contingency deadlines in the Contract were left blank. The parties had an opportunity to provide for contingency deadlines at the outset, but despite the Attorney Modifications Letter addressing the deficient closing date, no other deadlines were inserted. The Land was eventually subdivided on March 31, 2021, when the Property in question was given a PIN and legally documented. Only after the Land was subdivided could the remaining contingencies be addressed. Such unmet contingencies shall be discussed in turn, below.
§12 of the Contract: Soil Test

Defendant was expressly afforded the opportunity to obtain a soil test pursuant to Section 12 of the Contract, which states in pertinent part as follows:
“This Contract is subject to Buyer obtaining…a soil boring test and/or Flood Plain Determination at a site or sites of Buyer’s choice on the Property to obtain the necessary permits from the appropriate governmental authorities for the improvement contemplated by the Buyer…In the event…such tests are unsatisfactory, at the option of Buyer…this contract shall be null and void.” See Exhibit A of the Amended Complaint at §12.

Indeed, this provision was expressly affirmed by Plaintiffs’ attorney in an email from Plaintiffs attorney to Plaintiff, which Plaintiff then forwarded to Defendant on December 23, 2020. This email contained the final Contract for all parties to sign. Plaintiffs’ attorney specifically stated that “because this is vacant land, the Contract allows the Buyer the opportunity for EPA/soil testing (Paragraph 12).” See Email from Plaintiffs attorney attached hereto as Exhibit A of Exhibit 2.
After the subdivision of the Property was completed, Defendant received the soil testing report for the site from ERA, Inc. ERA, Inc. advised Defendant that the parcel was “part of a larger wetland larger than 0.10 acres,” “not eligible for the alternative analysis wetland submittal” and therefore “unbuildable.” The email from ERA, Inc.’s agent, Jon Green plainly stated, “in our

professional opinion the west half of the southerly parcel is not buildable.” See Email from Jon Green attached hereto as Exhibit B of Exhibit 2.
ERA, Inc. referred Defendant to the DuPage County Countywide Stormwater & Floodplain Ordinance Effective May 2019, which outlines very specific conservation and mitigation regulations that become triggered when a piece of property is classified as wetlands. According to the ordinance, which was also summarized in an email from ERA, Inc. on April 15, 2021, because a new home was being built on the easterly parcel of land, the southerly parcel (which contained the Property) would not be eligible for alternative analysis and mitigation and was unbuildable. See Ex. B of Ex. 2.
Defendant determined that the results of the soil test were unsatisfactory to him, and immediately notified Plaintiffs of same. Plaintiffs had actual notice within days of the soil test, that the Property was classified as wetlands and unsuitable for building. In fact, Defendant had been in almost constant contact with Plaintiffs regarding all aspects of the soil testing process and report. Moreover, Plaintiffs repeatedly requested documentation from the City of Warrenville refuting the wetland classification in order for the Contract to move forward. That documentation never came, and in fact, the City of Warrenville re-affirmed the presence of the wetland and stated that the Property was not suitable to build. See Ex. 3.
Upon notifying Plaintiffs of the wetland classification, Defendant had his attorney reach out to re-negotiate or terminate the Contract. Defendant was entirely within his rights to do so, as the determination of whether the soil test was satisfactory or unsatisfactory was at his sole discretion. See Contract at §12. When Plaintiffs stated that they were refusing to renegotiate terms, the Contract was lawfully terminated.
Respectfully, This Court already held that Buyer properly cancelled the Contract. In issuing its ruling, the Court explicitly stated the following:

“The wetland discovery mid-contract or mid-contract negotiation did cause buyer to properly cancel the contract, which I think they did properly in writing.” Ex. 4, p. 25.

Again, despite Plaintiffs’ filing of an Amended Complaint, this defect is not able to be cured. The wetland discovery mid contract caused Defendant to properly cancel the Contract, and he properly provided written notice of termination in accordance with his rights under §12 of the Contract. No amount of re-pleading can change what actually happened.
§11 of the Contract: Building & Sewage Permit Contingency

Pursuant to Section 11 of the Contract, the Contract is subject to the condition that Buyer obtain a building permit from the applicable governmental agency having jurisdiction over the subject Property. If Buyer is unable to obtain such a permit, he has the option to declare the Contract null and void. See Contract at §11.
While Defendant concedes that he did not formally apply for a building and sewage permit, the simple fact is that Defendant was unable to apply for such permit due to the wetland determination. Defendant’s first step in applying for the permit was to order the report on the Property. Once that report was issued and the wetland was discovered, a building permit would not have been able to be obtained until after certain mitigations were put in place. Accordingly, Defendant did not actually apply for such permit, because any application at that time would have been futile.
The Property is subject to all federal and local regulations, governed by the US Army Corps of Engineers and the DuPage Count Stormwater Management and Floodplain Ordinance Effective May 2019 and adopted by the City of Warrenville. Pursuant to that Ordinance, a building permit would not be issued by the City for a property located in a designated wetland area without substantial restoration and mitigation plans in place. In addition, according to ERA, Inc., because

there was already a house being built on the on the easterly parcel, the southerly parcel, which contained the Property, would never be suitable to build on.
Additionally, and importantly, Plaintiffs knew that Defendant’s obligation to close was contingent upon the Property being suitable for a residential build. In an email written to the City of Warrenville, Plaintiff writes to the Senior Civil Engineer stating, “David is requesting proof that this lot is buildable to close so I need something in writing to show [Defendant] that, if a permit is in fact ever submitted for a residential build, it is in fact would [sic] suitable to build on.” See Ex.
Plaintiffs knew that Defendant couldn’t close without the proof they could obtain a building permit. That proof never came.
Section 11 of the Contract was never waived by Defendant. Moreover, he provided timely notice of his inability to meet the building permit requirement in the Contract by providing said notice within two weeks of the subdivision.
3.  §17 of the Contract: Title Contingency

The title commitment contingency was also never met. Defendant concedes that there was no closing date set, and perhaps the customary time to provide a title commitment had not come. However, that does not excuse the obligations in §17. The delivery of a clear title policy to Buyer was a condition precedent to Buyer’s performance of the Contract. Plaintiffs were required to provide a title commitment, and Plaintiffs failed to do so.
This is important because any title commitment received on this property would have shown the designated wetland as impacting the property, and the wetland determination would have been raised as an exception.7 Accordingly, the Contract would have been terminated anyway based upon this unpermitted exception, at Buyer’s discretion.


7 The title commitment would certainly have raised the wetland exception because there was professional report with a map designating same, meaning that in the very least Defendant had every right to have it noted on title.

Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint Must be Dismissed with Prejudice as the Contract is not Enforceable.

In dismissing Plaintiffs’ original complaint, the Court found the Contract to be unenforceable. Specifically, in issuing its ruling, the Court stated the following:
“Also, and maybe most important, a contract a real estate sales contract without a closing date and without a description of a realty and a closing date of TBD is simply not an enforceable contract. That is the basis of my ruling.” Ex. 4, p. 25.

In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs attempt to fix this deficiency by providing the Attorney Modification Letter which modifies the Contract to include a closing date of “within 21 days” of the final subdivision. See Exhibit C to Amended Complaint. Despite the inclusion of a “closing date,” the parties never provided any other contingency date. Indeed, the inspection date, building permit date, and soil test date were all left blank despite the opportunity to modify the Contract post execution.
It is well settled in Illinois law that a contract for the sale of real estate cannot be specifically enforced by a court unless the writing evidencing the agreement contains the names of the seller and purchaser, a description of the property sufficiently certain so that it can be identified, the price of the property, the terms and conditions of sale and the signature of the party to be charged.” Werling v. Grosse, 76 Ill. App. 3d 834, 841 (5th Dist. 1979) (citing Cefalu v. Breznik, 15 Ill. 2d 168, 170 (1958); McDaniel v. Silvernail, 37 Ill. App. 3d 884, 886 (4th Dist. 1976)); see also Callaghan v. Miller, 17 Ill. 2d 595, 599 (1959). Illinois also requires the sale of real property be reduced to a writing. 740 ILCS 80/2 (West 2018). Extrinsic evidence is not permissible to cure ambiguity. McDaniel, 37 Ill. App 3d at 888 citing Crocker v. Smith, 366 Ill. 535 (1937).
In this matter, even with the inclusion of the Attorney Modification Letter, no definite terms and conditions of the sale were provided –no contingency deadlines were inserted at all. Moreover, the parties had an opportunity to execute a written instrument that set forth those

essential details after the property was subdivided, but they failed to do so. The only contract that exists between the party is the Contract that contains no dates whatsoever. Accordingly, as this Court cannot enforce the Contract, Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint must be dismissed with prejudice.
Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint Should be Dismissed Pursuant to §2-619 Because the Wetland Designation was a Material Mutual Mistake.8

The parties made a mutual mistake of fact relative to a material term of the Contract, which renders the Contract voidable.
Mutual Mistake is a defense against enforcement of a contract, and therefore an affirmative matter that defeats Plaintiffs’ claim, when (1) the mistake existed at the time of execution and was mutual and common to all parties; (2) the mistake was in a material element of the contract; (3) the mistake is of such grave consequence that to enforce the contract would be unconscionable;
(4) that the mistake occurred notwithstanding the exercise of due care on the part of the party seeking rescission; (5) the other party can be placed in statu quo. Keller v. State Farm Ins. Co., 180 Ill. App. 3d 539, 548 (5th Dist. 1989); Mid-Century Ins. Co. v. Founders Ins. Co., 404 Ill. App. 3d 961, 967 (1st Dist. 2010).
In this matter, at the time the Contract was made in December of 2020, all parties assumed the Land was buildable. No one thought it contained a wetland. Defendant entered into the Contract under the belief that the Land would ultimately be subdivided into buildable parcels. Neither party knew that the western portion of the Land, which was ultimately subdivided into the Property, was classified as containing a wetland.
The Contract price was negotiated based upon the assumption that the subdivided Property would be buildable. This assumption was later proven to be a mistake, when it was discovered

8 This Court has already ruled that the uncontested facts do not support a “mutual mistake” defense. Defendant is reasserting the argument for the record so that it is not waived for appeal purposes.

after the subdivision of the Land that the Property was, in fact, unbuildable. To be clear, the purchase price of the Contract was based on the mistaken belief that the Property was buildable. See Mid-Century Ins. Co. v. Founders Ins. Co., 404 Ill. App. 3d 961 (1st Dist. 2010) (holding that the parties must have had a mistaken belief that was not in accordance with the facts with respect to an important contract term). This mutual mistake of fact renders the Contract null and void.9
CONCLUSION

For the reasons set forth above, the Court must again dismiss Plaintiffs’ breach of contract claim. As Plaintiffs cannot fix the deficiencies by re-pleading, their Amended Complaint must be dismissed with prejudice. In addition, Defendant should be awarded his attorneys’ fees and court costs, which he is entitled to under the Contract.10
WHEREFORE, Defendant, DAVID RAUCH, respectfully requests that this Honorable Court grant its Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Complaint of Plaintiffs, with prejudice; for Defendant to be awarded his attorneys fees and costs; and for such other and further relief as this Court deems equitable and just.

9 Plaintiffs impermissibly ask this Court to award them statutory prejudgment interest. The Illinois Prejudgment Interest Statute, 735 ILCS 5/2-1313, applies only to personal injury and wrongful death actions, not breach of contract actions. Accordingly, Plaintiffs request for prejudgment interest in this matter is improper.
10 Section 28 of the Contract provides that “the prevailing Party in litigation shall be entitled to collect reasonable attorney fees and costs from the non-prevailing Party as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.” See Contract at ¶ 28.
