                    v.

         Case No. 2018L000103


          

PETITION TO VACATE DEFAULT JUDGMENT

	Jeffrey Chien (“Chien”) and Joshua Yount (“Yount”) bring this petition to vacate the March 14, 2019 default judgment entered against them. They were not properly served process and, therefore, the judgment is void. Chien and Yount also have meritorious substantive defenses they would have raised had they been properly summonsed. 
In support of their Petition, Chien and Yount state: 
A.	Introduction
1.	Iyka Enterprises, Inc. (“Iyka”) initiated this action on January 26, 2018 with a Verified Complaint against, among other defendants, RM2-LLC, Richard Maloney, Yount, and Chien. (Exhibit 1, Iyka’s Verified Complaint.) 
2.	Chien, Yount, and Maloney were and are members and agents of RM2-LLC (“RM2”). (Chien Aff. ¶ 2; Yount Aff. ¶ 2.) 
3.	Chien and Yount have not been active members in RM2 since in or around March 2017. (Chien Aff. ¶ 3; Yount Aff. ¶ 3.) To their knowledge, RM2 is not an active business. (Chien Aff. ¶ 3; Yount Aff. ¶ 3.) 
4.	Iyka’s allegations, asserted in its Verified Complaint (1/26/2018) and incorporated by reference in its Amended Complaint (9/11/2018) are based upon RM2’s business dealings with Iyka. (Ex. 1; Exhibit 2, Amended Verified Complaint, 9/11/2018.) 
5.	Neither Chien nor Yount personally had business dealings with Iyka. (Chien Aff. ¶ 4; Yount Aff. ¶ 4.) Yount was, however, an Iyka employee from approximately August 2016-March 2017. (Yount Aff. ¶ 4.) 
6.	In February or March 2018, Chien and Yount learned that RM2 had been served in this lawsuit via personal service upon Richard Maloney, their RM2 partner. (Chien Aff. ¶ 5; Yount Aff. ¶ 5.) 
7.	As addressed in detail below, neither Chien nor Yount were ever properly served, neither believed they were obligated to appear, and both believed the matter had been disposed of prior to the entry of the default judgment against them on March 14, 2019 (the “Default Judgment”).  
8.	On February 24, 2020, Yount discovered that Wells Fargo had debited approximately $11,500 from his Wells Fargo personal checking account. (Yount Aff. ¶ 6.) 
9.	Yount’s online Wells Fargo checking account indicated the cause of the removal of funds from his account was “LEGAL ORDER DEBIT – CONTACT DESIREE L FREEMAN (312) 725-2109.” (Yount Aff. ¶ 7.)  
10.	Later on February 24, 2021, Yount spoke with Desiree Freeman, Iyka’s counsel in this matter, who informed him the Default Judgment caused the Wells Fargo action against his account. (Yount Aff. ¶ 8.) 
11.	Yount requested a copy of the Default Judgment, and Freeman provided one to him via email February 24, 2021. (Yount Aff. ¶ 9.) Yount then provided a copy to Chien. (Yount Aff. ¶ 9.)
12.	Only then, on February 24, 2021, nearly two years from the entry of the Default Judgment, did Yount and Chien learn: (1) about the existence of the Default Judgment; and (2) that it was entered against each of them personally. (Chien Aff. ¶ 6; Yount Aff. ¶ 10.) 
13.	On February 25, 2021, Yount and Chien retained counsel to represent them, (Chien Aff. ¶ 7; Yount Aff. ¶ 11), exercising diligence once they learned of the Default Judgment.
14.	Prior to learning about the Default Judgment, including during the underlying proceedings, January 26, 2018-February 24, 2021, Chien and Yount each believed: (1) they had not been summonsed; (2) they were not obligated to act absent being summonsed; and (3) eventually, the case had been disposed of via dismissal with prejudice on January 8, 2019. (Chien Aff. ¶ 8; Yount Aff. ¶ 12.)
15.	Had Chien and Yount been properly summonsed, each would have retained counsel, appeared, defended himself (Chien Aff. ¶ 9; Yount Aff. ¶ 13), and presented meritorious defenses to Iyka’s claims (see ¶¶ 70-149 below). 
B.	Iyka’s Defective Service of Process on Chien & Yount
16.	The Clerk of the Circuit Court issued a summons to Chien on January 30, 2018. (Exhibit 5, Chien Summons.) That summons was addressed to Chien at 1034 Dawes Street, Libertyville, IL 60048-3539. (Id.)
17.	The Lake County Sheriff’s Office refused to attempt service of the January 30, 2018 summons upon Chien because there was “not enough time to serve.” (Exhibit 6, Lake County notice of rejection.) Iyka filed the document evidencing the Lake County Sheriff’s Office refusal. (Id.)
18.	The Clerk of the Circuit Court issued an original summons to Yount on February 1, 2018. (Exhibit 7, Yount Summons.) That summons was addressed to Yount at 2739 Myra Street, Jacksonville, FL 32205. (Id.)
19.	Yount did not reside at 2739 Myra Street, Jacksonville, Florida on February 1, 2018 or at any time within the thirty days thereafter, the effective period of the summons. (Yount Aff. ¶ 14.) At the time of the summons, Yount had not resided at 2739 Myra Street for years. (Yount Aff. ¶ 14.) 
20.	The Duval County Sheriff provided a return of service for the February 1, 2018 Yount summons indicating that “after due diligence to locate the name person, to wit: JOSHUA YOUNT, could not be found in DUVAL County Florida…PER THE CURRENT RESIDENT, THE DEFENDANT NO LONGER LIVES AT THE PROVIDED ADDRESS.” (Exhibit 8.) 
21.	In February or March 2018, Iyka served RM2 with a summons through its agent Maloney. (Chien Aff. ¶ 5, Yount Aff. ¶ 17.) Chien and Yount, from conversations with Maloney and based upon Yount’s receipt of a copy of the RM2 summons in this matter, were both aware RM2 had been served. (Chien Aff. ¶ 5; Yount Aff. ¶ 17.) 
22.	Chien and Yount also knew Maloney was working with counsel. (Chien Aff. ¶ 10, Yount Aff. ¶ 18.) Chien and Yount both believed, erroneously, Maloney was handling the case for Chien, Maloney, Yount, and RM2. (Chien Aff. ¶ 10, Yount Aff. ¶ 18.) 
23.	On June 11, 2018, the Clerk of the Circuit Court issued an alias summons. (Exhibit 9, Summons, 6/11/2018.)
24.	Unlike the original summonses, the June 11, 2018 alias summons was not individually addressed to each defendant, with a separate summons being directed to each client as required. (See Ex. 9.) 
25.	The June 11, 2018 alias summons lists “RM2-LLC et. al.” on the caption over the word “DEFENDANT.” (Ex. 9.)
26.	Neither Yount nor Chien are listed on the caption. (Ex. 9.) 
27.	In the form field, “To each Defendant:_________”, the June 11, 2018 alias summons contains the phrase “See attached Service List.” (Ex. 9.)
28.	Neither Yount nor Chien are listed as a defendant to whom the June 11, 2018 alias summons is directed. (Ex. 9.) 
29.	Neither Yount nor Chien’s name appears on the face of the June 11, 2018 alias summons at all. (Ex. 9.) 
30.	The June 11, 2018 alias summons itself does not contain the referenced service list. (Ex. 9.) 
31.	A document titled “Service List” was filed as an exhibit on June 11, 2018. (Exhibit 10.) 
32.	Chien is listed on the Service List with the address 1034 Dawes Street, Libertyville, Illinois 60048. (Ex. 10.) 
33.	Chien resided at 1034 Dawes Street, Libertyville, Illinois 60048 at the time of the June 11, 2018 alias summons. (Chien Aff. ¶ 11.) 
34.	Chien, on information and belief, received a copy of the June 11, 2018 alias summons and the Verified Complaint in June 2018. (Chien Aff. ¶ 12.) Chien pleads this on information and belief because he remembers a Lake County officer delivering papers to his home but is uncertain of the date. (Id.)  
35.	Chien’s belief upon receiving the June 11, 2018 alias summons,  which was not issued to him and did not bear his name, was that he had received a copy of the lawsuit and summons against RM2, which Maloney was handling. (Chien Aff. ¶ 13.) He specifically noticed that the document was not issued or addressed to him. (Id.) 
36.	The June 11, 2018 summons was defective as it was not issued to Chien, did not contain Chien’s name on its face, and did not put Chien on notice that he had been served and was required to appear. 
37.	Yount is also listed on the Service List that purportedly accompanied the June 11, 2018 alias summons with the address 2739 Myra Street, Jacksonville, FL 32205. (Ex. 10.) 
38.	Yount did not reside at 2739 Myra Street, Jacksonville, FL 32205 on June 11, 2018 or any of the thirty days thereafter, (Yount Aff. ¶ 14), the effective period of the June 11, 2018 alias summons (see Ex. 9). Yount had not resided there for years. (Yount Aff. ¶ 14.) 
39.	Yount never received a copy of the June 11, 2018 alias summons (Yount Aff. ¶ 16).
40.	On July 16, 2018, the Clerk of the Circuit Court issued a second alias summons. (Exhibit 11.) 
41.	The July 16, 2018 alias summons, like the June 11, 2018 alias summons, lists on the caption over the word “DEFENDANT,” “RM2-LLC et. al.” (Ex. 11.) 
42.	In the form field, “To each Defendant:_________”, the July 16, 2018 alias summons, like the June 11, 2018 alias summons, contains the phrase “See attached Service List.” (Ex. 11.) 
43.	Yount’s name does not appear on the caption or the “To each Defendant” field of the July 16, 2018 alias summons. (Ex. 11.) Yount’s name does not, in fact, appear anywhere on the July 16, 2018 alias summons. (Id.)
44.	No “Service List” is part of or attached to the July 16, 2018 alias summons, and no such document was filed on or around that date. (Ex. 11, Exhibit 12, Docket Report.)  
C.	Iyka’s Motion for Service by Special Order of Court
45.	On October 17, 2018, Iyka filed a Motion for Service by Special Order of Court pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-203.1. (Exhibit 13, Motion.) 
46.	In the Motion for Service by Special Order of Court, Iyka alleged: 
5. On June 11, 2018, Alias Summonses were issued for the Defendants.

6. Alias Summons was placed with the Duval County, Florida, Sheriff for service on Joshua Yount at his new address, 2628 Sigma Court, Orange Park, FL 322005, which was obtained by Iyka and its counsel through outside investigation. Once again, the Sheriff was unable to serve Yount and informed Iyka’s counsel via telephone on or about July 2, 2018.  
(Ex. 13.)

47.	The Service List filed contemporaneously with the June 11, 2018 alias summons listed Yount’s address as 2739 Myra Street, Jacksonville, FL 32205, (see Ex. 10), not 2628 Sigma Court, Orange Park, Florida 322005 as Iyka asserted in its Motion for Service by Special Order of Court (Ex. 13 ¶ 6). 
48.	Regardless, Yount did not reside at 2628 Sigma Court, Orange Park, Florida or at 2739 Myra Street, Jacksonville, Florida on June 11, 2018 or at any time within the thirty days following the issuance of the June 11, 2018 alias summons. (Yount Aff. ¶¶ 14-16.) He had not lived at either address for years. (Yount Aff. ¶¶ 14-15.) 2628 Sigma Court was not Yount’s “new address,” as Iyka claimed. (Yount Aff. ¶ 15.) 
49.	Iyka further asserted in its Motion for Service by Special Order of Court: 
8. On July 16, 2018, Second Alias Summonses were issued for Defendants Yount, Sawicki, Ignition Innovations, and Ignition Assets.
(Ex. 13 ¶ 8.) 

50.	Contrary to Iyka’s assertion, a single alias summons listing “See attached Service List” in the “To each Defendant” field of the summons form was issued on July 16, 2018. (Ex. 11, Ex. 12.) 
51.	Yount’s name does not appear in the caption or the addressee field of the July 16, 2018 alias summons, or anywhere else on the summons. (Ex. 11.) 
52.	Further, there is no service list attached to the July 16, 2018 alias summons or filed separately contemporaneously therewith. (Ex. 11; Ex. 12.) 
53.	Yount was never served with the July 16, 2018 alias summons. (Yount Aff. ¶ 16.) 
54.	Yount never took any steps to avoid service or conceal his location. (Yount Aff. ¶ 20.) 
55.	On October 29, 2018, based upon Iyka’s Motion for Service by Special Order of Court, the Court ordered: 
That service may be effectuated on Defendant Joshua Yount at 2628 Sigma Court, Orange Park, Florida 32205, by (1) mailing summons and complaint in a properly addressed envelope via regular fist-class U.S. Mail, postage pre-paid; and (2) by Federal Express delivery service, no signature required for delivery…

(Exhibit 14, Order, 10/29/2018.) 
56.	On January 7, 2019, Iyka filed a Certificate of Proof of Service. (Exhibit 16.) The Certificate of Proof of Service states: 
The undersigned served the below parties with the 1) Order for Service by Special Order of Court entered On October 29, 208, 2) Alias Summons, and 3) Verified Amended Complaint on November 2, 2018 by placing the aforementioned in a Federal Express envelope property addressed to each of the following…

Joshua Yount 
2628 Sigma Court
Jacksonville, FL 32205
…
Before 5:00 p.m. on the 2nd day of November, 2018. Pursuant to the attached confirmations from Federal Express, the aforementioned parties received the documents on November 7, 2018. 
(Ex. 16.) 
57.	The record indicates no alias summons issued to Yount following the October 29, 2018 order or at any time after the July 16, 2018 alias summons (Ex. 12), indicating that if Iyka did in fact attempt to serve Yount via U.S. mail and FedEx, as permitted by the October 29, 2018 order (Ex. 14), it must have done so with an expired summons. 
58.	Pursuant to its own Certificate of Proof of Service, Iyka did not serve Yount by U.S. Mail and FedEx as required by the Court’s order (Ex. 14), but only by FedEx, (Ex. 16.) 
59.	Further, as noted above, Yount did not reside at 2628 Sigma Court, Jacksonville Florida on November 2, 2018 or at any time thereafter and had not resided there for years. (Yount Aff. ¶ 15.)
D.	Iyka’s Motion for Default Judgment
60.	Iyka filed Plaintiff’s Motion for Default Judgment on February 4, 2019. (Exhibit 15.)
61.	In its Motion for Default Judgment, Iyka alleged regarding service on Chien: 
On June 20, 2018, Defendant Chien was properly served with process. See Affidavit from the Lake County Sheriff’s Office, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4. Pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 181(a), this defendant’s appearances and responsive pleadings were due on July 18, 2018. 
(Ex. 15, ¶ 5.) 
62.	The purported affidavit of service was not filed after it was returned. (See Ex. 12, docket report.) 
63.	The purported affidavit of service was not attached as Exhibit 4 to the Motion to Default as Iyka had indicated in its motion. (Ex. 15, Ex. 12.) 
64.	As discussed in detail above, assuming the June 11, 2018 alias summons was the method by which Chien was served on June 20, 2018, that document was not issued or addressed to Chien on its face. (See above ¶¶ 35-36.) 
65.	As to Yount, in the February 4, 2019 Motion for Default Judgment, Iyka asserted: 
On November 2, 2018, Defendants Yount, Sawicki, Ignition Innovations, and Ignition Assets were properly served with process. See Certificate of Proof of Service filed on January 7, 2019 and FedEx delivery confirmations dated November 7, 2018, copies of which are attached hereto as Group Exhibit 8. 
(Ex. 15 ¶ 9.) 

66.	As addressed above: 
a.	The Certificate of Proof of Service filed January 7, 2019 indicated Iyka had served Yount via FedEx to 2628 Sigma Court, Jacksonville, FL 32205 on November 2, 2018. (Ex. 16.) 
b.	Yount did not live at 2628 Sigma Court, Jacksonville, FL at the time and had not for years. (Yount Aff. ¶ 15.)
c.	Contrary to the Court’s October 29, 2018 order, Ikya failed to serve the papers via U.S. Mail. (Ex. 14, Order; Ex. 16, COS.)
d.	No alias summons had issued after July 16, 2018, and, therefore, any alias summons served upon Yount in November 2018 would have been expired. (Ex. 12.) (¶ 57 above.)
e.	If the July 16, 2018 alias summons was the summons sent by FedEx to Yount, that alias summons did not contain Yount’s name (¶ 43 above) or an attached service list (¶ 44 above).  
67.	Based upon Iyka’s Motion for Default Judgment, the Court entered the Default Judgment against Chien and Yount on March 14, 2019 in the amount of $363,625.41. (Exhibit 17.)
68.	Valid service of process was never made upon Chien, and the Default Judgment against him is void. 
69.	Valid service of process was never made upon Yount, and the Default Judgment against him is void. 
E.	Chien & Yount’s Substantive Defenses
70.	Chien and Yount did not appear and defend themselves because they believed they did not have to, and they believed that because they had not been served with summonses issued to them. (Chien Aff. ¶ 15; Yount Aff. ¶ 12.)
71.	Had Chien or Yount received a proper summons in this matter, they would have appeared and defended against Iyka’s claims, which they believed (and still believe) to be frivolous. (Chien Aff. ¶ 15; Yount Aff. ¶ 13.) 
72.	Once Chien and Yount became aware of the Default Judgment, they immediately retained counsel and acted diligently to defend their interests. (Chien Aff. ¶¶ 6-7; Yount Aff. ¶¶ 9-11.)
1)	Iyka did not introduce facts sufficient to support its claims, even by default.
 
73.	As a threshold matter, Iyka’s Verified Complaint was not, in fact verified. The Verification is not signed by Iyka. (Ex. 1.) Iyka also failed to verify the Amended Verified Complaint. (Ex. 2.) Accordingly, the facts alleged in the Amended Verified Complaint were not before the Court for the purpose of granting Iyka’s Motion for Default Judgment against Chien and Yount. 
74.	The affidavits from Iyka’s counsel and Iyka’s president, Poonam Gupta, attached to Iyka’s Motion for Default Judgment do not assert sufficient facts to support judgment in Iyka’s favor on any of the ten counts it raised. (See Ex. 15.) 
75.	Iyka’s counsel, Desiree L. Lauricella, submitted an affidavit addressing her fees. (Ex. 15 at Affidavit of Desiree L. Lauricella.) That affidavit does not support any of the ten counts in Iyka’s Amended Verified Complaint. (See Ex. 1, Ex 2.) 
76.	Poonam Gupta-Krishnam, Iyka’s president, submitted an affidavit that contained: 
a.	statements regarding the authenticity and admissibility of Iyka’s business records (¶ 3); 
b.	conclusory allegations regarding contract formation (¶¶ 4-5); 
c.	a conclusory allegation that the defendants defaulted on multiple agreements (¶ 10); 
d.	reference to Exhibit 1, Iyka’s calculation of damages, without swearing to veracity of or explaining the basis for the same. (¶ 12.) 
(See Ex. 15 at Affidavit of Ponnam Gupta-Krishnam.) 
77.	The facts supported by affidavit did not support relief for any of the counts Iyka alleged in the unsigned Amended Verified Complaint. 
78.	No other affidavits were submitted in support of Iyka’s Motion for Default Judgment. 
2)	Iyka’s breach of contract claims (Counts I, II, and III) are conclusory and unsubstantiated, and Chien and Yount would have refuted them. 

79.	Ikya’s Count’s I (Breach of Contract – First Agreement – against the RM2 Defendants), Count II (Breach of Contract – Reseller Agreement – against the RM2 Defendants), and Count III (Breach of Contract – Letter of Intent – against the RM2 Defendants) all plead Chien and Yount’s purported breaches of contract by reference to paragraphs 38-46 of the Verified Complaint (See Ex. 2 ¶¶ 51, 64, 77). 
80.	Paragraphs 38-46 of the Verified Complaint allege, in summary: 
a.	Prior to March 22, 2017, “the RM2 defendants, upon information and belief, transferred confidential information about RM2’s and Iyka’s marketing, branding, promotion and sale strategies of dataSpryng to Sawicki and the Ignition Defendants.” (Ex. 1 ¶ 38.) 
b.	Prior to March 22, 2017, Yount “upon information and belief, used his position as an employee of Iyka to access and transfer confidential information about RM2’s and Iyka’s marketing, branding, promotion, and sale strategies of dataSpryng to Sawicki and the Ignition Defendants.” (Ex. 1 ¶ 39.)
c.	Iyka suffered “irreparable injury” because the defendants “obstructed Iyka’s busines.” (Ex. 1 ¶ 40.)
d.	Around March 22, 2017, Iyka “learned of the existence of the Ignition Defendants and Sawicki’s and the RM2 Defendants’ involvement therewith.” Iyka, through Poonam Gupta-Krishnan, demanded that RM2, Chien, and Yount sign “a Non-Disclosure/Non-Compete Agreement” but that they refused. (Ex. 1 ¶ 41.) 
e.	“Upon information and belief, RM2 does not and cannot possess any rights to license, brand, market, promote, or sell the dataSpryng technology, and the RM2 defendants knew this….and failed to inform Iyka.” (Ex. 1 ¶ 42.) 
f.	Iyka terminated Yount on March 22, 2017. (See Ex. 1 ¶ 43.)
g.	Iyka sent RM2 a demand letter on April 4, 2017. (See Ex. 1 ¶ 44.)
h.	RM2 ignored Iyka’s demand letter. (See Ex. 1 ¶ 45.)
i.	“…there is due and owing from the RM2 Defendants to Iyka a total of approximately $315,137.61” which includes $215,400 for Iyka employee salaries. (See Ex. 1 ¶ 46.) 
81.	Iyka’s allegations are misleading. 
a.	Iyka fails to state what “confidential information” RM2 provided to Sawicki and the Ignition Defendants. 
b.	To Chien and Yount’s knowledge, RM2 provided nothing to Sawicki or the Ignition Defendants. (Chien Aff. ¶ 17, Yount Aff. ¶ 23.) Neither Chien nor Yount personally provided any confidential information to Sawicki or the Ignition Defendants. (Chien Aff. ¶ 18, Yount Aff. ¶ 24.) Additionally, Poonam Gupta-Krishnam fails to mention that she introduced Sawicki, a contractor, to the Iyka/RM2 relationship while insinuating Chien and Yount surreptitiously involved him with their dealings. (Chien Aff. ¶ 19, Yount Aff. ¶ 26.)
c.	Iyka failed to provide any facts supporting its allegation it was “irreparably harmed” or evidencing what “obstruction” to its business it suffered. 
d.	Iyka points to Chien and Yount’s refusal to sign a post hoc non-disclosure and non-competition agreement as evidence they breached a confidentiality agreement. (Ex. 1 ¶ 41.) 
e.	Iyka fails to allege facts explaining how Chien or Yount caused any of the damages alleged. Iyka and RM2 never made revenue from their work together. (Chien Aff. ¶ 24, Yount Aff. ¶ 31.) Chien and Yount had never even heard of the Iyka employees whose salaries Iyka claims Chien and Yount are somehow liable for. (Chien Aff. ¶ 25, Yount Aff. ¶ 32.) 
f.	“dataSpryng” is uReveal software, which Iyka through Poonam Gupta-Krishnan insisted upon renaming as part of its marketing efforts. (Yount Aff. ¶¶ 27-28, 30.) Contrary to Iyka’s unsupported allegation, RM2 had an express, contractual right to “license, brand, market, promote, or sell the [uReveal] technology.” (Chien Aff. ¶¶ 20-22; Chien Aff. Ex. A (RM2/uReveal reseller agreements), Yount Aff. ¶¶ 27-28.) 
82.	Had Chien and Yount been summonsed, they would have retained counsel and appeared and successfully defended against Iyka’s unsubstantiated claims. 
3)	Count I: Iyka does not state a breach of contract claim against Chien or Yount personally.   

83.	In Count I, Iyka asserts a claim against the “RM2 Defendants” (RM2, Maloney, Chien, and Yount) for breach of contract on what Iyka calls the “First Agreement.” (Ex. 1 ¶¶ 47, 49.) 
84.	The First Agreement is attached as Exhibit 4 to the Verified Complaint and to this Petition as Exhibit 18. 
85.	The First Agreement is titled: “Agreement between: RM2_LLC and Iyka,” and it is dated June 21, 2016. (Ex. 18.)
86.	The scope section of the First Agreement provides: “This Agreement is between RM2-LLc (sic) and Iyka.” (Ex. 18 ¶ 2.)
87.	The signature block of the First Agreement lists, in one column, “For Iyka” with Poonam Gupta’s signature. (Ex. 18 at 2.) 
88.	The second column reads: “For RM2-LLC”, lists Yount, Chien, and Maloney’s names, and bears Yount, Chien, and Maloney’s signatures for RM2. (Ex. 18 at 2.) 
89.	Chien and Yount are not parties to or personally bound by the First Agreement, which is solely between Iyka and RM2. 
90.	Members of limited liability companies are not personally liable for contracts entered by their companies, and Iyka was not and is not entitled to relief from Chien and Yount on Count I. 
91.	Had Chien and Yount been summonsed, they would have appeared and raised a meritorious defense or defenses against Ikya’s Count I, and Iyka would not have prevailed. 
4)	Count II: Chien and Yount are not personally liable for the Reseller Agreement and RM2-LLC never entered the Reseller Agreement. 

92.	In Count II, Iyka asserts a claim against the “RM2 Defendants” (RM2-LLC, Maloney, Chien, and Yount) for breach of contract on the “Reseller Agreement.” (Ex. 1 ¶ 60.) 
93.	The Reseller Agreement is attached as Exhibit 1 to the Verified Complaint and to this Petition as Exhibit 19. 
94.	The Reseller Agreement states that it is “By and between” “Iyka Enterprises, Inc.” and “RM2-LLC.” (Ex. 19.) 
95.	The Reseller Agreement is dated July 1, 2016. (Ex. 19.) 
96.	Neither Yount nor Chien are parties to the Reseller Agreement. (Ex. 19 at 1, 6.) 
97.	Limited liability members are not liable for the contracts of their limited liability companies, and Iyka was not and is not, therefore, entitled to recover from Chien and Yount personally under Count II. 
98.	Further, to Chien and Yount’s knowledge and belief, RM2-LLC never entered into the Reseller Agreement with Iyka or agreed to be bound. (Chien Aff. ¶ 16; Yount Aff. ¶ 22.) The signature block for RM2, to be executed by Maloney, was not signed. (Ex. 19 at 6.) 
99.	Accordingly, RM2 never agreed to be bound by the Reseller Agreement, let alone Chien and Yount personally. 
100.	Had Chien and Yount been summonsed, they would have appeared and successfully raised a meritorious defense or defenses against Ikya’s Count II.
5)	Count III: Iyka does not state a claim for breach of contract against Chien or Yount personally. 

101.	In Count III, Iyka asserts a claim against the “RM2 Defendants” (RM2-LLC, Maloney, Chien, and Yount) for breach of contract based upon a December 16, 2016 letter of intent (“Letter of Intent”). (Ex. 1 ¶ 75.)  
102.	The Letter of Intent is attached to the Verified Complaint as Exhibit 5 and to this Petition as Exhibit 20. 
103.	The Letter of Intent is addressed to RM2 and to Iyka and not to Chien or Yount. (Ex. 20.) 
104.	The Letter of Intent is signed “For Iyka” by Poonam Gupta-Krishnan and “For RM2-LLC” by Maloney. (Ex. 20 at 4.) 
105.	Chien and Yount are not parties to the Letter of Intent. (See Ex. 20.) 
106.	Individual members are not liable for the contracts or liabilities of their limited liability companies.
107.	There is no basis for a judgment against Chien or Yount on Count III.   
108.	Had Chien and Yount been summoned, they would have appeared and successfully raised a meritorious defense against Ikya’s Count III. 
6)	Count IV: Iyka fails to state a claim against Yount for breach of an employment agreement, and Iyka committed a prior, material breach, barring its recovery. 

109.	In Count IV, Iyka asserts a breach of contract claim against Yount for breach of his employment agreement with Iyka (“Employment Agreement”). (Ex. 1 ¶ 87.) 
110.	Iyka attached the Employment Agreement to its Verified Complaint as Exhibit 3 (see Ex. 1, ¶ 89), and a copy is attached to this Petition as Exhibit 21. 
111.	The Employment Agreement provided, among other things, that Iyka would provide Yount health insurance. (See Ex. 21 at 1.) 
112.	The Employment Agreement also provided that Yount’s “salary and related expense is a loan from Iyka to RM2.” (Ex. 21 at 1.) 
113.	Iyka alleges that Yount breached his employment agreement by breaching the First Agreement, Reseller Agreement, and Letter of Intent. (Ex. 1 ¶ 91.) 
114.	Iyka does not plead facts to support its conclusory allegations of Yount’s breaches. (See Ex. 1 ¶¶ 87-100.)
115.	And again, as discussed above, Yount was not a party to any of those agreements. 
116.	Further, Iyka never provided Yount health insurance as promised in the Employment Agreement. (Yount Aff. ¶ 25.) This failure constitutes a material breach of the Employment Agreement. 
117.	Given Iyka’s material breach, Iyka cannot enforce the Employment Agreement against Yount. 
118.	Further, Iyka’s damages are based upon sums, assuming its allegations are true, owed to it by RM2, not Yount personally. Iyka seeks “the return of all monies paid to Yount” (Ex. 1 ¶ 93), which it claims are $48,519 (id. ¶ 95), but RM2, not Yount, was responsible for the ultimate payment of those wages which were to be treated as a loan from Iyka to RM2, (see Ex. 21 at 1 (“Your salary and related expense is a loan from Iyka to RM2”).)  
119.	Further still, Iyka is, in essence, claiming that Yount must return wages paid to him, which is impermissible under the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act, (see 820 ILCS 115/9).
120.	Had Yount been properly summonsed to court and therefore cognizant of the need to appear and defend, he would have defended against Count IV, and he would have prevailed.  
7)	Counts V & VI: Iyka does not state a claim for fraud or fraud in the inducement against Chien or Yount, and Chien and Yount made no misrepresentations. 

121.	In Count V, Iyka asserts claims against the “RM2 Defendants” (RM2-LLC, Maloney, Chien, and Yount) for fraud. (Ex. 1 ¶ 101.) 
122.	In Count VI, Iyka restates the allegations against the “RM2 Defendants” (RM2-LLC, Maloney, Chien, and Yount) as a fraud in the inducement claim. (Ex. 1 ¶ 109.) 
123.	Fraud must be alleged with specificity. 
124.	In Iyka’s fraud counts, it alleges:
the RM2 Defendants deceived Iyka by never informing Iyka of their knowledge and intent to provide confidential information about the dataSpryng technology to the Ignition Defendants and Sawicki. 
(Ex. 1 ¶¶ 105, 113.) 

125.	Iyka does not allege facts to establish any affirmative obligation of disclosure on the part of Chien or Yount as required for fraud by omission. (See Ex. 1 generally). 
126.	Generally, a party may not recover in tort for what is essentially a breach of contract. Iyka alleges it “relied on the representations of the RM2 Defendants, as well as the terms of the agreements…when deciding to execute the Agreements with RM2.” (Ex. 1 ¶¶ 106, 114.) Other than the contract terms, which were between Iyka and RM2, Iyka does not allege any specific representation by Chien or Yount. 
127.	Iyka claims:
At some time before March 22, 2017, Maloney, Chien, and/or Yount provided the confidential information about dataSpryng to the Ignition Defendants and Defendant Sawicki. These actions constitute breaches of the Agreements by the RM2 Defendants, which have not been cured to date.

(Ex. 1 ¶¶ 107, 115.) 
128.	Iyka itself, in its fraud counts, equates a breach of contract to fraud. 
129.	Iyka fails to disclose that Iyka introduced Christopher Sawicki to the business arrangement. (Chien Aff. ¶ 19; Yount Aff. ¶ 26.) Chien and Yount could not have fraudulently induced Iyka to enter contracts by concealing intentions to deal with someone they did not yet know. 
130.	Additionally, RM2 owned the rights to the dataSpryng technology, not Iyka. Chien and Yount had worked for a company called uReveal that sold a software also named uReveal. (Chien Aff. ¶¶ 20-21; Yount Aff. ¶ 28.) RM2 and Chien had contractual approval from uReveal to resell the software. (Chien Aff. ¶ 21; Chien Aff. Ex. A; Yount Aff. ¶ 28.) 
131.	The purpose of the relationship between RM2 and Iyka was to combine product expertise (RM2) with marketing expertise (Iyka). (Chien Aff. ¶ 22; Yount Aff. ¶ 29.) Iyka insisted on re-branding the uReveal software as dataSpryng. (Chien Aff. ¶ 23; Yount Aff. ¶ 30.) Doing so did not strip RM2 of its contractual rights with uReveal, nor did it make “dataSpryng” a separate technology owned by Iyka.  
132.	Iyka also alleges that Chien and Yount’s purported frauds cost it $315,137.61. (Ex. 1 ¶¶ 108, 116.) Iyka and RM2-LLC did not generate any revenue through their joint venture (Chien Aff. ¶ 24, Yount Aff. ¶ 31), and Iyka provides no factual allegations whatsoever to explain how Chien or Yount caused such damages.  
133.	Had Chien and Yount been summonsed, they would have appeared and raised meritorious defenses against Ikya’s Counts V and VI. 
8)	Counts VII, VIII & IX: Iyka does not state claims for tortious interference against Chien and Yount.

134.	In Count VII, Iyka asserts claims against the Chien and Yount for tortious interference with contracts. (Ex. 1 ¶ 117.) 
135.	In Count VIII, Iyka asserts claims against the Chien and Yount for tortious interference with existing business relations. (Ex. 1 ¶ 122.) 
136.	In Count IX, Iyka asserts claims against the Chien and Yount for tortious interference with a prospective economic advantage. (Ex. 1 ¶ 132.) 
137.	Iyka’s tortious interference claims as to Chien and Yount can be summarized as follows: Chien and Yount caused RM2-LLC to breach its contract with Iyka (Ex. 1 ¶¶ 118-121, 123-131, 133-142.) 
138.	Limited liability companies act through their agents.
139.	Iyka attempts to impose liability upon Chien and Yount, who were agents of RM2 (Chien Aff. ¶ 2, Yount Aff. ¶ 2) and who were not parties to the RM2 and Iyka agreements, by repackaging its breach of contract claims against RM2 as torts by Chien and Yount. 
140.	Iyka makes no allegation that Chien and Yount were not acting on behalf of RM2 when they engaged in their allegedly tortious conduct. 
141.	Additionally, tortious interference claims require the interference of a third party. Here, Iyka claims that Chien and Yount, who were RM2 for the purposes of this arrangement, interfered with the Iyka/RM2 agreements and relationship. 
142.	Iyka’s position, if valid, would mean that every breach of contract by an entity includes a claim for tortious interference by that entity’s agent or agents. 
143.	Had Chien and Yount been summonsed, they would have appeared and raised meritorious defenses against Ikya’s Counts VII, VIII, and IX. 
9)	Count X: Iyka does not state a claim for quantum meruit against Chien or Yount. 

144.	In Count X, Iyka asserts claims against the Chien and Yount for quantum meruit. (Ex. 1 ¶ 143.) 
145.	Iyka’s business relationship was with RM2, not Chien or Yount. (Chien Aff. ¶ 4, Yount ¶ 4.) 
146.	As with its contract claims, Iyka’s claim for quantum meruit, if any, is against RM2, not Chien and Yount. 
147.	Iyka did not provide goods or services to Chien or Yount. (Chien Aff. ¶ 26, Yount Aff. ¶ 33.) 
148.	Iyka did not, in any event, provide anything close to $315,137.61 in value to the RM2 Defendants. (Chien Aff. ¶ 26; Yount Aff. ¶ 33.) Iyka did not successfully market RM2’s product to a single customer. (Chien Aff. ¶ 24; see Yount Aff. ¶ 31.)
149.	Had Chien and Yount been summonsed, they would have appeared and raised a meritorious defense against Ikya’s Count X.  
Wherefore, Jeffrey Chien and Joshua Yount respectfully request that this Court: 
A.	Vacate the March 14, 2019 Default Judgment as to Chien on the basis that he was not properly served and the Default Judgment is void as to him; 
B.	Vacate the March 14, 209 order as to Chien pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-1401; 
C.	Dismiss Chien from this matter, including any citation proceedings directed to him, with prejudice; 
D.	Vacate the March 14, 2019 Judgment as to Yount because he was never served and the Default Judgment is void as to him; 
E.	Vacate the March 14, 209 order as to Yount pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-1401; 
F.	Dismiss Yount from this matter, including any citation proceedings directed to him, with prejudice; 
G.	Grant Chien and Yount an evidentiary hearing on this Petition to the extent Iyka contradicts the facts set forth herein by affidavit or exhibit; and
H.	Grant to Chien and Yount any further relief that the Court deems equitable. 
Respectfully submitted, 

Jeffrey Chien & 
Joshua Yount
