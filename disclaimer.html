                <h2>Not Legal Advice</h2>
                <p>DemandAI is not a law firm and is not a substitute for an attorney or law firm. DemandAI cannot provide legal advice, legal opinions, legal recommendations, or other legal services. The information provided by DemandAI, including all demand letters generated through our service, is not legal advice and should not be construed as legal advice.</p>
                <p>The demand letters generated by our service are generic templates that have been enhanced by AI technology and customized based on the information you provide. These letters are designed to be a starting point for your communication needs but may not address the specifics of your legal situation or the laws in your jurisdiction.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
                <h2>No Attorney-Client Relationship</h2>
                <p>No attorney-client relationship is created by using DemandAI. This includes our Attorney-Reviewed service tier, which involves an attorney reviewing and potentially editing your demand letter. This review service does not establish an attorney-client relationship and does not constitute legal representation.</p>
                <p>The reviewing attorney does not represent you in any legal matter and is not providing personalized legal advice specific to your situation. They are merely reviewing the document for general professional formatting and content.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
                <h2>No Guarantee of Results</h2>
                <p>DemandAI does not guarantee any specific outcome or result from the use of our demand letters. The effectiveness of a demand letter depends on many factors, including the specific facts of your situation, applicable laws, and the recipient's response.</p>
                <p>We do not guarantee that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your demand will be satisfied</li>
                    <li>You will receive any response to your demand letter</li>
                    <li>Your demand letter will prevent litigation or other legal proceedings</li>
                    <li>Your demand letter complies with all applicable laws in your jurisdiction</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
                <h2>Consult an Attorney</h2>
                <p>For specific legal advice regarding your situation, you should consult with a licensed attorney in your jurisdiction. Only a licensed attorney who has been engaged to represent you can provide legal advice tailored to your specific circumstances and the laws that apply to your situation.</p>
                <p>We strongly recommend consulting with an attorney before taking any action that may affect your legal rights or obligations, especially for complex legal matters or disputes involving significant amounts of money or important rights.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
                <h2>Accuracy of Information</h2>
                <p>The demand letters generated by DemandAI are based on the information you provide. The accuracy and effectiveness of these letters depend on the accuracy and completeness of the information you input. DemandAI is not responsible for any inaccuracies, omissions, or errors in the demand letters that result from incomplete or inaccurate information provided by users.</p>
