         Case No. 2022LA000580

         Jury Trial Demanded 
          

RESPONSE TO MOTION TO DISMISS

	Each of David Rauch’s (“Rauch”) arguments is premised on disputed facts, and Rauch has failed to establish that any of his affirmative matters legally defeat the Complaint. Accordingly, the Motion to Dismiss (“Motion”) should be denied.  
Statement of Facts
	In 2020, Frank Mnuk and Jessica Raymond bought land in Warrenville, specifically, the North ½ of Lot 13 in Warrenville Estates (the “Land”) with the intention of building a house. (Compl., ¶ 5.) In November 2020, Rauch introduced himself as the owner of the lot adjacent the Land. (Id. at ¶ 6.) In December 2020, Rauch emailed Mnuk asking him to propose a purchase price for the western portion of the Land (the “Property”). (Id. at ¶¶ 4, 7.) Mnuk and Rauch then negotiated terms. (See Id. at ¶ 8.) 
During negotiations, Rauch informed Mnuk he was seeking the Property to expand his lot, not to build a house. (Exhibit 1, Frank Mnuk Affidavit, ¶ 4.) Rauch informed Mnuk he was building a house on his lot north of the Property. (Id. at ¶¶ 2-3.) Mnuk nor Raymond ever represented to Rauch that the Property was buildable. (Id. at ¶ 5; Exhibit 2, Jessica Raymond Affidavit, ¶ 2.) Mnuk and Rauch ultimately retained attorneys to formalize and document their agreement. (Compl. ¶ 8.) 
	On December 23, 2020, Rauch entered a formal written agreement with Mnuk and Raymond for the sale of the Property (the “Agreement”). (Id. at ¶ 10.) The purchase price was $190,000. (Id. at ¶ 14(a).) The Land was subdivided on March 31, 2021. (Id. at ¶ 22.) After the subdivision, Mnuk attempted to get Rauch to move forward with the Agreement and schedule a closing, but Rauch refused. (Id. at ¶¶ 23-29; Ex. 1 ¶ 20.) 
	Environmental Resource Associates, Inc. (“ERA”) prepared a “Wetland Delineation Report” dated March 24, 2021 regarding “3s701 Mignin Drive.” (Ex. 1 ¶ at 10, Ex. 1 at Ex. B.) This report does not purport to be a soil test or flood plain determination. (See Ex. 1 at Ex. B.) On information and belief, the Land, the Property, and Rauch’s land north of the Property were all identified as 3s701 Mignin Drive prior to subdivision. (Id. at ¶ 1.) ERA appears to have analyzed Rauch’s property, not the Property. The “Project Location Study” identified at page 11 of ERA’s report suggests, with a red box around the subject property, that it evaluated Rauch’s parcel. (Id. at ¶ 12.) 
	Jon Green of ERA is the only person the Plaintiffs are aware of who has ever concluded that the Property is unbuildable. (See id.) Jon Green does not work for Warrenville or have any authority to determine whether the Property is buildable. (Id. at ¶ 14.) Contrary to Rauch’s assertions based on Green’s assertions, Mnuk believes the Property is buildable, and a Warrenville engineer has confirmed that the Property has not been deemed unbuildable. (Id. at ¶ 7.) 
Rauch nor his attorneys ever terminated the Agreement. Rauch did not provide any written notice of termination of the Agreement. (Id. at ¶ 16; Ex. 2 at ¶ 3.) Nor did Rauch provide any notice he had applied for a building permit but was rejected. (Ex. 1 at ¶ 17.) Nor did Rauch ever ask for a title commitment, which would have been provided within customary time limitations sufficiently in advance of closing had Rauch ever committed to or scheduled a closing. (Id. at ¶¶ 20-22; Exhibit 3, Affidavit of Thomas Alore, ¶¶ 3-4.) 
Discussion
Rauch argues the Complaint must be dismissed because there were contingencies within the Agreement that were never satisfied. Specifically, Rauch argues that the following were unsatisfied contingencies: (1) a soil test contingency based upon Paragraph 12 of the Agreement; (2) a title commitment contingency pursuant to Paragraph 17 of the Agreement; and (3) a building permit contingency pursuant to Paragraph 11 of the Agreement.  Additionally, Rauch argues the parties made a mutual mistake by assuming the Property was buildable and that Mnuk and Raymond negligently misrepresented that the property was buildable.	
A defendant may file a Section 2-619 motion to dismiss on the basis “that the claim asserted against defendant is barred by other affirmative matter avoiding the legal effect of or defeating the claim.” 735 ILCS 5/2-619(a)(9). If that affirmative grounds for dismissal are not in the complaint, they must be supported by affidavit. 735 ILCS 5/2-619(a). Where the other party presents affidavits “denying the facts alleged or establishing facts obviating the grounds of defect,” the court may deny the motion. 735 ILCS 5/2-619(c). In the case of a jury demand, if there are disputed questions of fact, the motion must be denied. Id. 
	A Section 2-619 motion allows for the “dismissal of a complaint on the basis of issues of law or easily proven issues of fact, while disputed questions of fact are reserved for trial proceedings[.]” Advocate Health & Hosps. Corp. v. Bank One, N.A., 348 Ill. App. 3d 755, 759 (1st Dist. 2004). In ruling on a Section 2-619 motion, the trial court must take all well-pleaded facts of the complaint as true. Thompson v. Frank, 313 Ill. App. 3d 661, 663 (3d Dist. 2000). Dismissal is only appropriate “where it is clearly apparent no set of fact can be proved that would entitle the plaintiff to recover.” Gavery v. McMahon & Elliott, 283 Ill. App. 3d 484, 486 (1st Dist. 1996); Wood ex rel. Harrold v. Vill. of Grayslake, 229 Ill. App. 3d 343 (2d Dist. 1992). A Section 2-619 motion should only be granted if there are no genuine issues of material fact. Sharpenter v. Lynch, 233 Ill. App. 3d 319, 323 (2d Dist. 1992). Dismissal is not appropriate unless the motion raises affirmative matter that completely negates the cause of action. Daiwa Bank v. LaSalle Nat’l Trust, N.A., 229 Ill. App. 3d 366, 384 (2d Dist. 1992). 
1.	Rauch did not conduct a soil test or flood plain determination on the Property and did not terminate the Agreement; therefore, Paragraph 12 of the Agreement does not relieve him from performance.

Paragraph 12 provides: 
This Agreement is subject to Buyer obtaining within __ Business Days from date of acceptance a soil boring test and/or Flood Plain Determination at a site or sites of Buyer’s choice on the Property to obtain the necessary permits from the appropriate government authorities for the improvement contemplated by the Buyer. Such determination and tests shall be at Buyer’s expense. In the event of Flood plain Determination and such tests are unsatisfactory, at the option of Buyer, and upon written notice to Seller within one (1) business day of the time set forth above, this contract shall be null and void…In the event the Buyer does not serve written notice within the time specified herein, this provision shall be deemed waived by all parties hereto and this contract shall continue in full force and effect. 

(Compl. Ex. A, ¶ 12.)

	Rauch asserts: he “had contracted with [ERA] to provide a soil test on the subdivided Property” (Mot. at 3); the “Property was ‘not eligible for a new home’ pursuant to DuPage County Countywide Stormwater & Floodplain Ordinance Effective May 2019” (Id. at 4); upon reaching the opinion the Property was “unbuildable” he “had the absolute right to terminate the Agreement” (Id. at 4); and that when “the parties failed to re-negotiate the Agreement to account for the disclosure, the Agreement was terminated” (Id. at 4 (citing Ex. 2 ¶ 23 (“April 21, 2021, Plaintiffs’ attorney emailed my attorney with their refusal to renegotiate. Accordingly, the Agreement was terminated”).)
	Based upon these facts, Rauch argues that the Agreement “was lawfully terminated” and the Complaint should be dismissed. Rauch is wrong. The Agreement was not terminated pursuant to Paragraph 12 of the Agreement for several reasons. First, Rauch did not obtain a “soil boring test and/or Flood Plain Determination” test. Rather, Rauch obtained a “Wetland Delineation Report.” (Ex 1, ¶ 10 & Ex. 1B.) Paragraph 12 only provided Rauch the option to terminate the Agreement based upon a “soil boring test and/or Flood Plain Determination.” He did not have the right to terminate the Agreement for any other reason or analysis, whether it be a “Wetland Delineation Report,” or some other land study, such as an environmental report, an endangered species study, or agricultural suitability test. 
	Second, ERA appears to have analyzed Rauch’s land north of and bordering the Property, not the Property at issue. (Id. at ¶ 12.) ERA’s Wetland Delineation Report suggests that its study was conducted on Rauch’s land. (Id.)
	Third, Rauch did not have an “absolute right to terminate the Agreement.” Rather, Rauch had a right to terminate the Agreement under Paragraph 12 if he obtained a soil boring and/or flood plain determination (he did not) and he “serve[d] written notice” of termination “within the time specified herein.” Rauch may have threatened to terminate the Agreement (see Mot. Ex. C), but he never gave written notice to Mnuk or Raymond that he was terminating the Agreement. (Ex. 1 ¶¶ 15-18.) Because of this, Rauch never directly states in his Motion or affidavit that he terminated the Agreement. Rather, he avoids the issue by asserting he had the “right to” terminate and that “the Agreement was terminated,” as if termination was self-executing and there was no notice requirement. There was, of course, a notice requirement, and Rauch failed to abide by it, waiving his rights under Paragraph 12 by its own explicit terms. (Compl. Ex. A ¶ 12 “In the event the Buyer does not serve written notice within the time specified herein, this provision shall be deemed waived...”.) 
Accordingly, dismissal is inappropriate because there are genuine issues of material fact and facts Mnuk and Raymond can prove that entitle them to relief, specifically, there was no soil test or flood plain determination, and Rauch never terminated the Agreement. Further, there is a jury demand in this case, and a jury should decide these issues of fact. See 735 ILCS 5/2-619(c).
2.	Because Rauch refused to commit to or schedule a closing, the transaction never reached the point where a title commitment would have been provided “within customary time limitations and sufficiently in advance of closing”, and, therefore, Paragraph 17 of the Agreement does not relieve him from performance. 

Paragraph 17 provides: 

…Seller will deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer or Buyer’s attorney within customary time limitations sufficiently in advance of Closing, as evidence of title in Seller or Grantor, a title commitment for an ALTA title insurance policy in the amount of the Purchase Price…The commitment for title insurance furnished by Seller will be presumptive evidence of good and merchantable title as therein shown, subject only to the exceptions therein stated. If the title commitment discloses unpermitted exceptions, or if the Plat of Survey shows any encroachments which are not acceptable to Buyer, then seller shall have said exceptions or encroachments removed, or have title insurer commit to insure against loess or damage that may be caused by such exceptions or encroachments. If Seller fails to have unpermitted exceptions waived or title insured over prior to Closing, Buyer may elect to take the title as it then is, with the right to deduct from the Purchase Price prior encumbrances of a definite or ascertainable amount. 

(Compl. Ex. A, ¶ 17 (emphasis in original).) 

	Rauch repeatedly complains that Mnuk and Raymond did not provide a title commitment pursuant to Paragraph 17, completely ignoring the fact that he refused to commit to a closing date. (See Compl. ¶¶ 23-30; Ex. 1 ¶ 20). A title commitment would have been provided to Rauch within “customary time limitations and sufficiently in advance of closing” had Rauch ever committed to or scheduled closing. (Ex. 1 ¶ 22; Ex. 3.) In other words, the transaction never matured to the point where a title commitment would have been issued, which is further evidenced by the fact Rauch never demanded a title commitment or complained one had not been provided, (see id. at ¶ 10). Rauch does not and cannot claim or prove a title commitment was not provided “within customary time limitations sufficient in advance of Closing” and therefore cannot escape liability based on Paragraph 17. At the very least, there is a fact issue as to whether that period had passed, and a jury should determine that issue. This should end the analysis, but Mnuk and Raymond also address Rauch’s arguments regarding Paragraph 17 below.  
Rauch argues that had Mnuk and Raymond “provided a title commitment to [Rauch], that title commitment would have disclosed an unpermitted exception related to the classification of the Property as ‘wetlands’ and therefore subject to state and regulatory law relative to conservation and prohibition on building.” (Mot. at 10-11 (citing 20 ILCS 830/3/-2).) Rauch’s assertion, mixed of law and fact, is wholly conclusory and unsupported by the facts and law he presents. 
First, who says that there is a “wetland designation” or a “classification of the Property as ‘wetlands’”? Plaintiff does not allege in his affidavit that the Property is “designated” or “classified” as wetlands, nor would he be competent to make that assertion. Plaintiff points to Jon Green of ERA and his emails (see Mot. Ex. B), but Jon Green does not work for any relevant government entity. The Court is not bound to follow Jon Green’s purported conclusion, particularly where he hasn’t been qualified as an expert, has not submitted an affidavit in this case, has not been deposed, and has not been subjected to cross examination. The wetland delineation is not an “easily proved fact” appropriate for resolution on a 2-619 motion. 
	Second, Rauch assumes a wetland designation would constitute an “exception” on a title commitment under Paragraph 17. This conclusion is devoid of any support, whatsoever. A title exception is “any lien, declaration, easement, restrictive covenant or other instrument, charge, encumbrance or agreement affecting title to the Subject Property[.]” https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/title-exception.  The title insurance company cares about whether the seller has good title, not whether there is a wetland on the property. 
Rauch cites to 20 ILCS 830/3-2, claiming that it supports his position that a wetland would constitute an “exception” on a title commitment. (Mot. at 10.) That provision of the Interagency Wetland Policy Act of 1989 (“Act”) provides that wetlands “purchased, restored or created as a result of this Act shall be protected through either easements or fee simple transfer” to a public or private conservation entity. The Property does not contain a wetland “purchased, restored or created as a result of” the Act. Further, the Act applies to preserve wetlands from loss “due to State supported activities,” and there is no state activity here. 805 ILCS 830/1-4. Read as a whole, it is clear the Act is meant to apply to state lands, not private lands. See 20 ILCS 830/1-1 et seq. For these reasons, 20 ILCS 830/3-2, is inapplicable.
Rauch has failed to establish that Paragraph 17 of the Agreement applies, and there are, at least, factual issues regarding its applicability. Accordingly, the Court should deny Rauch’s motion. 

3.	The building permit contingency is inapplicable because Rauch did not “properly, diligently, and promptly” apply for any building permit, and, therefore, Paragraph 11 of the Agreement does not relieve him from performance. 

Paragraph 11 of the Agreement provides: 
If Buyer(s) has properly, diligently, and promptly applied for said permits and approvals and has been unable to obtain the permits within the times specified, Buyer(s) may, at Buyer’s option, within one (1) business day of the time specified, serve written notice of such failure and inability to obtain the necessary permits…and in such event this Agreement shall become null and void…IN THE EVENT BUYER(S) DOES NOT SERVE WRITTEN NOTICE WITHIN THE TIME SPECIFIED HEREIN, THIS PROVISION SHALL BE DEEMED WAIVED BY ALL PARTIES HERETO AND THIS CONTRACT SHALL CONTINUE IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.

(Compl. Ex. A, ¶ 11.) 
	Rauch asserts that he “could not obtain a building permit for the Property as it was discovered after the subdivision that the Property was classified as wetlands and therefore unbuildable.” (Mot. 10.) Based on this premise, he argues the Agreement became null and void. 
	Rauch is wrong for two reasons. First, Rauch never applied for building permits. (See Mot., Mot. Ex. A (Rauch Affidavit).) Rather, he concluded he could not build based on an opinion ERA issued. (See Mot. at 10.) This is insufficient. The Agreement specifically required that he apply for permits, not that he is the arbiter of whether he would obtain a permit if he tried.
Second, as noted above, ERA’s opinion, upon which Rauch’s argument is premised, is not sacrosanct. ERA appears to have analyzed the wrong land. ERA and Jon Green have no legal authority to determine what is buildable, have not submitted affidavits in this case, and have not been subjected to discovery or cross-examination. 
Third, Rauch never served written notice of his inability to obtain a permit or permits. He could not have served such notice because there was never a determination by the governing authority that he could not obtain a permit or permits. Without detail or citation, Rauch claims “he provided timely notice of his inability to meet the building permit requirement….” (Mot. at 11.) In his affidavit, Rauch points to an April 16, 2021 email where he claims he “notified Plaintiffs [sic] that the land was unbuildable…” (Mot. Ex. 2 ¶ 22-22) The email, by Rauch’s attorney, states that “if one of those options is not acceptable to Mr. Mnuk, my client will accept a termination of the contract.” (Mot. Ex. 2C.) What it does not say is that Rauch failed to obtain permits (see Compl. Ex. A, ¶ 17 (“written notice of such failure and inability to obtain the necessary permits”) or that he is terminating the Agreement. Accordingly, Paragraph 17 of the Agreement does not relieve Rauch of his obligation under the Agreement. 
4.	There was no mutual mistake of fact regarding whether the Property was buildable. 

Rauch argues that there was a mutual mistake that bars the enforcement of the Agreement. The mistake, he claims, was that “all parties assumed the land was buildable.” (Mot. at 11.) 
In order for the doctrine of mutual mistake to apply, “the party seeking rescission must show by clear and positive evidence that a mistake has been made in a material feature of the contract, that the mistake is of such grave consequence that to enforce the contract would be unconscionable, that the mistake occurred notwithstanding the exercise of due care on the part of the party seeking rescission, and that the other party can be placed in statu quo.” Keller v. State Farm Insurance Co., 180 Ill. App. 3d 539, 548, 536 N.E.2d 194, 200 (5th Dist. 1989)
	Here, there was no mutual mistake. Mnuk did know prior to the Agreement whether the Property was buildable. (Ex. 1 at ¶ 6.) He nor Raymond represented to Rauch that the land was buildable. (Id. at ¶ 5; Ex. 2 at ¶ 2.) He would not have had a reason to make any such representation because Rauch had informed Mnuk he was interested in the Property to extend his existing lot to the north of the Property, not to build a house. (Id. at ¶ 4.) 
	Additionally, whether the Property was buildable was not a “material feature of the contract.” The Agreement may have provided Rauch avenues to investigate the buildability of the Property, but (1) the Agreement does not state that the Property is buildable, i.e., buildability is not a feature of the Agreement at all, and (2) Rauch failed to exercise the provisions of the Agreement related to buildability, waiving them. 
	Further, if there is a mistake, it is not “of such grave consequence that to enforce the contract would be unconscionable.” “Unconscionability has two facets--one that is procedural and one that is substantive.” Zobrist v. Verizon Wireless, 354 Ill. App. 3d 1139, 1147 (5th Dist. 2004). “The party asserting unconscionability has the burden of proving both procedural and substantive unconscionability.” Hubbert v. Dell Corp., 359 Ill. App. 3d 976, 986, 835 N.E.2d 113, 123 (5th Dist. 2005)
“Procedural unconscionability consists of some impropriety during the process of forming the contract depriving a party of a meaningful choice.” Zobrist, 354 Ill. App. 3d at 1147. The factors of procedural unconscionability include “the manner in which the contract was entered into, whether each party had a reasonable opportunity to understand the terms of the contract, and whether important terms were hidden in a maze of fine print[.]” Zuniga v. Major League Baseball, 2021 IL App (1st) 201264, ¶ 14.
Here, Rauch provides no facts or argument as to how the Agreement was procedurally unconscionable. There was no impropriety during the negotiation process, Rauch was not deprived on a meaningful choice, Rauch was represented by counsel, Rauch had a reasonable opportunity to understand the terms of the Agreement, and important terms were not hidden. 
Substantive unconscionability involves “totally one-sided or oppressive” contracts. Labuz v. Labuz, 2016 IL App (3d) 1409, ¶ 51. “A substantive unconscionability analysis requires that the contract be ‘so unfair that the court cannot enforce it consistent with the interests of justice.’”  In re Prill, 2021 IL App (1st) 200516, ¶. A substantively unconscionable agreement is one “no man in his senses” would make and “no fair and honest man would accept.” Labuz, 2016 IL App (3d) 1409, ¶ 51. 
Rauch does not establish substantive unconscionability. He does not explain how the agreement was unfair or one-sided. He asserts that the Property was worth $80,000 less because it is unbuildable, but there is no evidence that the price decrease had anything to do with buildability, and there is a preliminary factual dispute as to whether the Property is in fact buildable. Regardless, an Agreement for the purchase of more than one acre of land in Warrenville for $190,000 is not “so unfair that the court cannot enforce it consistent with the interests of justice” or one that “no man in his senses” would enter it. 
Turning to the “due care” element of the doctrine of mutual mistake, Rauch tellingly avoids the issue and does not explain what due care he took to avoid making the purported mistake of assuming the Property was buildable. For this reason alone, the doctrine does not apply. Rauch could have, but did not, request that Mnuk allow him to inspect the Property prior to entering into the Agreement. If he had done so, he either could have reached his conclusion regarding buildability prior to obligating himself, or, had Mnuk demurred, he could have declined to enter the Agreement. Rauch took no care whatsoever to avoid making his purported mistake.
5.	Mnuk nor Raymond ever represented to Rauch that the land was buildable. 

Rauch claims the “Agreement was voided by Defendant due to the negligent misrepresentation by Plaintiffs that the land was ‘buildable.’” (Mot. at 14.) Rauch provides no legal authority to support his assertion that a negligent representation voids a contract. Regardless, Rauch never stated that he intended to build on the Property, and Mnuk believed Rauch was purchasing it to increase the size of his lot, which bordered the Property and on which Rauch told Mnuk he was building a house. (Ex. 1 at ¶¶ 2-6.) Neither Mnuk nor Raymond ever represented to Rauch that the Property was buildable. (Id. at ¶ 5; Ex. 3 at ¶ 2.) Further, Rauch’s argument is premised on the assumption the land is not buildable, which has not been established. Rauch has not carried his burden of establishing the “affirmative matter”, and there is, at the very least, a factual issue was to whether there was a representation about buildability. 
Conclusion
	The Court should deny the Motion, order Rauch to answer the Complaint, and set a discovery schedule. 
Respectfully submitted, 

Frank Mnuk &
Jessica Raymond
